# Tiny

A demo HTTP server for testing purposes. To build, run `make`, and then `[sudo] ./tiny`. Tiny will listen on port 80. Note that Tiny will not look at HTTP header fields, except for the method, path, and payload. Currently, Tiny may not be entirely safe either.

NOTE: still a work in progress
